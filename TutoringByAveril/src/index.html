        Teaching:
        <p>
          A teacher (also called a school teacher or, in some contexts, an educator) is a person who helps others to acquire knowledge,
          competences or values. Informally the role of teacher may be taken on by anyone (e.g. when showing a colleague
          how to perform a specific task). In some countries, teaching young people of school age may be carried out in an
          informal setting, such as within the family (homeschooling), rather than in a formal setting such as a school or
          college. Some other professions may involve a significant amount of teaching (e.g. youth worker, pastor). In most
          countries, formal teaching of students is usually carried out by paid professional teachers. This article focuses
          on those who are employed, as their main role, to teach others in a formal education context, such as at a school
          or other place of initial formal education or training.

        Enthusiasm:
        <p>
          A teacher interacts with older students at a school in New Zealand It has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm
          towards the course materials and students can create a positive learning experience.[9] These teachers do not teach
          by rote but attempt to find new invigoration for the course materials on a daily basis.[10] One of the challenges
          facing teachers is that they may have repeatedly covered a curriculum until they begin to feel bored with the subject,
          and their attitude may in turn bore the students. Students who had enthusiastic teachers tend to rate them higher
          than teachers who didn't show much enthusiasm for the course materials.[11] A primary school teacher on a picnic
          with her students, Colombia, 2014 Teachers that exhibit enthusiasm can lead to students who are more likely to
          be engaged, interested, energetic, and curious about learning the subject matter. Recent research has found a correlation
          between teacher enthusiasm and students' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom.[12] Controlled,
          experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of
          enthusiasm, such as demonstrative gesturing, dramatic movements which are varied, and emotional facial expressions,
          result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn.[13] But even while a teacher's
          enthusiasm has been shown to improve motivation and increase task engagement, it does not necessarily improve learning
          outcomes or memory for the material.[14]
